#Rockets Blazing
###'cause who wants to get there second?
This is hobby project of mine to experiment with web hosting and web services like cloud storage, email, website, rss and whatever a user may need on the internet.
I had a few key motivations to start on this endeavour, some of them being:
*Getting my personal data back from big corporations.
*Creating a service that i could use myself and share with my friends.
*And perhaps most importantly, developing an understanding of how things work, its not magic.
The idea is that anyone can make his own server to cater to his/her own needs as well as deploy at a large scale. Even if none decides to do it for themselves, if a well documented method exists to create their own internet sevices, it gives power to the user. And they should not feel locked into big corporations products.
##Getting Started
Even though there are wonderful tools like wordpress and many others to host your own free websites, it doesnt satisfy my goal no.3 as stated. And perhaps its wiser to understand the basics to worksmanship before starting to build a castle.
I have broken down this ardous task to doable sections:
*get a grasp of html, css and javascripts(in that particular order)
explanation: the theory is this will help you understand the static section of the web, i.e. websites, blogs etc.
*learn to use a webserver and run it on self monitored machine.
explanation: again we have to slowly build up the concepts, the idea is to learn the physical aspects of hosting
*Setup a full time running server with working applications like email, cloud storage etc. the point is to make something useful.
##The Future
There are many technologies that are now shaking up what many thought were the basics of the internet. Whatever you have learned will not go to waste, keep improving and look at ideas that could change how we use the internet, some of which might be:
*Inter-planetary Filesystem aka IPFS
*Blockchain based decentralised applications like Steemit
*Linux as the mainstream OS?
*Decentralised Internet applications?
