title: "Sprint Schedule"
---

Timeline:

April 23rd, Community Bonding: Tasks
1. Week of regular talks to discuss backlog ideas and suggest new ones.
2. Integrate the Ndvi Algorithm you implemented for the challenge into the WPS.
3. Get your doubts cleared
4. Align goals with organisation's.

May 14th, Start work on Project: Tasks
1. Add process 'copernicus-import-product' to import Copernicus Data into WPS.
2. Make the process compliant with OGC WPS standards. User should be able to interactively tell the server to download the data, or load it from the disk.
3. Integrate the Ndvi Algorithm with import 'copernicus-import-process' to generate Ndvi band on WPS.
4. Weekly blog update on progress and daily mail updates to mentors.

June 11th, First Evaluations: Tasks
1. Complete the evaluations
2. Make a demo of the running application, posts about useful features for the blog.
3. Update Sprint Schedule if necessary

June 15th, Continue Programming: Tasks
1. Start work on the second algorithm implementation using the Operator class in org.esa.snap.gpf. (Discuss in the Community bonding period which one)
2. Generalise the algorithm class to form the basis for 'myoperator' which will be extended to implement future algorithms.
3. Make a process for the 2nd algorithm for WPS

July 9th, Second Evaluations: Tasks
1. Complete the evaluations
2. Extensive blog articles, tutorials detailing the features of the project.
3. Update the Sprint Schedule as necessary. After discussing backlog and new ideas.

July 13th, Continue Programming
1. Lots of optimizations and annotations in the code, make it easier for the next guy to work on it too.
2. Make the WPS much more capable of handling Copernicus data, higher level data.
3. Resolve the issue of Level2A data for parts other than Europe. If the data is still not available.
4. Make sure the code can be commited upstream to 52North WPS.

August 6th, Pens down: Hope for the best!
1. Complete the evaluations.
2. Write a blog post to summarize the experience.

August 21st, You are independent Open Source contributor now!
